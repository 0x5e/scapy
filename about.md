This is a fork of [scapy](http://www.secdev.org) to make it compatible with python3. Fork based on scapy v2.3.1. pip package name is scapy-python3.

All tests from regression (758 tests), ipsec, and both other test suites pass. Also, I tested full tutorial series [Building Network Tools with Scapy by @thepacketgeek](http://thepacketgeek.com/series/building-network-tools-with-scapy/) using scapy-python3.

Please, report all issues to: [https://github.com/phaethon/scapy/issues](https://github.com/phaethon/scapy/issues) preferrably with .pcap files for tests. Bugs for individual layers are usually easy to fix.

[winpcapy.py by Massimo Ciani](https://code.google.com/p/winpcapy/) integrated inside code.

See, [getting started]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started) and [cookbook]({{ site.baseurl }}/cookbook) for examples.
