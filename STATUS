Working:
Can be installed with 'python3 setup.py install'
scapy prompt loads, layers load (not all tested), can create and send packet (e.g. pkt = Ether() / IP() )

Somewhat working commands:
- conf
- hexdump
- ls
- lsc
- pkg.show() # quickly tested for IP and Ether layers
- rdpcap
- sr1,sr, srp1, srp
- sniff
- wrpcap

Not working:
Unresolved import issue in plist.py affecting gnuplot
layers/inet.py issue with replacing new.instancemethod

Implementad changes in all files:
- updating print to function form
- replaced raise e, v -> raise e(v) (PEP3109)
- replaced except e, v -> except e as v (PEP3110)
- fixed nested function definition parameter with sublist (parameter unpacking)
- ditto for lambda
- removed L from long integers
- changed backticks to repr()
- changed xrange to range
- converted tabs to spaces, some files had mix of them
- replaced iteritems,iterkeys,itervalues to items,keys,values
- replaced __metaclass__ with (metaclass=)
- replaced has_key to key in dict
