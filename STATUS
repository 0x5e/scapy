Working:
Can be installed with 'python3 setup.py install'
scapy prompt loads, layers load (just a few tested), can create and send packet

- conf
- hexdump
- ls
- lsc
- pkg.show(), pkg.show2()
- rdpcap
- sr1,sr, srp1, srp
- sniff
- traceroute
- wrpcap

Not working:
- gnuplot (Unresolved import issue in plist.py affecting gnuplot, layers/inet.py issue with replacing new.instancemethod)
- all that depends on crypto

- updating print to function form

- fixed nested function definition parameter with sublist (parameter unpacking)
- ditto for lambda
- removed L from long integers
