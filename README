This is a fork of scapy (http://www.secdev.org) to make it compatible with python3. Fork based on scapy v2.3.1
I could go through whole tutorial series Building Network Tools with Scapy by @thepacketgeek (http://thepacketgeek.com/series/building-network-tools-with-scapy/) using scapy3k. File STATUS inside distribution contains more info on current status.

All commands listed by lsc() should work. Tested layers are:
- ARP
- DNS
- Dot3
- Ether
- ICMP
- ICMPv6
- IP
- IPv6
- LLC
- Padding
- Raw
- SNAP
- STP
- TCP
- UDP

Currently, works on Linux, Darwin, Unix and co. Using python 3.4 on Ubuntu and FreeBSD for testing. Windows support in progress.

On all OS except Linux libpcap and libdnet should be installed for sending and receiving packets (not python modules - just C libraries). Without libdnet packets can be sniffed, but not sent. Also, netifaces module can be used for alternative and possibly cleaner way to determine local addresses.

Please, submit all issues https://github.com/phaethon/scapy3k preferrably with .pcap files for tests. Bugs for individual layers are usually easy to fix.
