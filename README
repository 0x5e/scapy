This is a fork of scapy (http://www.secdev.org) to make it compatible with python3. Fork based on scapy v2.3.1
I could go through whole tutorial series Building Network Tools with Scapy by @thepacketgeek (http://thepacketgeek.com/series/building-network-tools-with-scapy/) using scapy3k. File STATUS inside distribution contains more info on current status.

All commands listed by lsc() should work. Tested layers are:
- ARP
- DNS
- Dot3
- Ether
- ICMP
- ICMPv6
- IP
- IPv6
- LLC
- Padding
- Raw
- SNAP
- STP
- TCP
- UDP

Currently works only on Linux. Using python 3.4 on Ubuntu linux for testing. Other OS support in progress.

Please, submit all issues https://github.com/phaethon/scapy3k preferrably with .pcap files for tests. Bugs for individual layers are usually easy to fix.
